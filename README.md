Based on the tutorial at: https://towardsdatascience.com/kaggle-titanic-machine-learning-model-top-7-fa4523b7c40

* Training Dataset = train.csv
* Testing Dataset = test.csv
* Final Notebook = Feature_Engineering.ipynb
* Predictions (for Kaggle) = titanic_fastai2.csv

I was using Google Colaboratory as my Jupyter notebook environment.
